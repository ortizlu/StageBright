# stagebright

> This is a project that I tried building using Vue. Due to time constraints, I defaulted to using Handlebars for the Views. This is a hub for creatives all around the world to showcase their work. It will eventually be invite only, so as to make the quality of the work much better. The app is currently pushed to https://stagebright.herokuapp.com/
