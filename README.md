# stagebright

> This is a project that I tried building using Vue. Due to time constraints, I defaulted to using Handlebars for the Views. This is a hub for creatives all around the world to showcase their work. It will eventually be invite only, so as to make the quality of the work much better. The app is currently pushed to https://stagebright.herokuapp.com/

The app that is currently showcased is in the branch WOVUE (meaning: Without Vue) In the future I hope to implement Vue and transform the back-end to push out JSON
